the output is not predictable due to the fact the tasts are overlapping in insertion times 
both fight over the same protected resources queue and the schedualer sets the fight
by choosing which task would insert the number first , 
0.5 seconds and 1.0 seconds , each second time the 0.5s task inserts 
the 2 tasks are "supposed" to insert the number in the same time into the protected 
struct , the fight is sattled by the schedualer each time in a different manner
hence the random results...
