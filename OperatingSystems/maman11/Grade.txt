## 

For OS students,
Following is a list of typical errors encountered in the assignments submitted by the course students. 
While it might be, that your work has no problems from the mentioned bellow, you can find it educational to read the list.

1. Please don't submit extra files like executable files etc'. Also extra foldering is really unnecessary.
   Next times I'll penalize for it.
2. Name of the make file must be Makefile or makefile only, no extensions.
   Please verify that 'make' instruction compiles all the files (exe/lib) required by the certain maman.
3. Name of executable file MUST conform the name required at maman description.
4. Submit SINGLE ZIP file for the whole maman (including theory and the programming task).
5. Theory: please submit SINGLE doc/rtf/pdf. English language is preferable. 
   It can be (AND EVEN BETTER TO BE) uploaded at the same ZIP as the programming task as it have been mentioned above.
6. Maman11 won't be penalized for late submission. Next mamans: 2 points of penalty for each extra day (except Sat).
7. Please read very careful the maman description before start working on it.

Good luck at OS course.

Regards, Grader.

Question 2:
--------------------------------------------
Batch System
The batch system performs one job at a time. It has a tray full of jobs and the system performs them. 
When one job is complete the system continues to the next job. The system continues one by one until all the jobs are complete. 
Multiprogramming System
The multiprogramming system partitioned the memory into several pieces. 
These pieces were used to store several jobs. While one job was waiting for I/O, 
other jobs could continue their execution and get the CPU time they need. 
This method solved the problem of the CPU being idle while the program waited for I/O. 
However, the CPU will not switch jobs until that specific job is waiting for I/O or terminated.
Time Sharing System
This is a variant of the multiprogramming system. Each job gets a time share from the CPU 
to use (only if the job is not waiting I/O or idle). This way multiple jobs get CPU time. 
This prevents one job from hogging the CPU. On the other hand, idle and blocked jobs (I/O) 
allow the CPU to continue handling large jobs that need the CPU at that time. 
Distributed System
A distributed operating system appears to the user as one computing element (CE). 
However, a distributed system consists of several processors or CEs that process in 
parallel different parts of a job or different jobs. The user is not aware that there 
are multiple processing units are handling his jobs. 

Question 3
--------------------------------------------
1) The TRAP instruction switches from user mode to kernel mode and starts execution at fix 
address within the kernel once the system call handler has completed its task the control 
may be returned to the user mode by the TRAP instruction
2) An interrupt is an asynchronous signal from hardware indicating the need for attention or 
a synchronous event in software indicating the need for a change in execution. A hardware i
nterrupt causes the processor to save its state of execution via a context switch, and begin 
execution of an interrupt handler. Software interrupts are usually implemented as instructions 
in the instruction set, which cause a context switch to an interrupt handler similar to a 
hardware interrupt. TRAPS are used by a program to invoke system calls and switch to 
kernel mode and back. 

Question 4:
--------------------------------------------
A Program is the Algorithm itself written as executable code. 
A Process is the activity of running the code (the program) for a 
certain set on input parameters (a process has a program, input, output 
and state).


Question 5:
Blocking I/O.
--------------------------------------------
Calling blocking I/O in such case can bring system to deadlock or starvation situation
E.g.:
When threads are implemented in the kernel and make blocking I/O operation, the kernel will
execute a context switch and schedule another thread for running. However, if hardware 
interrupts are temporarily blocked, when the I/O device finishes and sends an interrupt, 
it won't be handled. Blocking I/O operation will continue to block since it won't get the 
data it required. But, if the blocking I/O operation is in a critical section, then no 
other thread will be able to execute the critical section because it already locked.


Question 6.
--------------------------------------------
LRU Least Recently Used Algorithm is used for managing memory pages, it replaces the least recently used page with a new page, 
thus helping to reduce the page faults.
Using LRU algorithm for buffer cache management has two main drawbacks:
a.	It may take a while before blocks which are modified in the cache are written back to disk. 
Therefore a system crash may cause loss of data. If a modification to a critical block is lost, 
the file system may be left in an inconsistent state, or even totally destructed in extreme cases. 
For this reason, modified critical blocks must be written back to disk immediately, rather than wait until 
they reach the front of the queue.
b.	Some special blocks, such as I-nodes, are less likely to be referenced again soon than other blocks. 
Such blocks should not take valuable space in the buffer cache, and therefore must be placed on the front the 
queue rather than on the back.


Question 7:
Peterson solution.
--------------------------------------------
  
According to Peterson solution, the critical part is final and the process that goes in will go 
out and let another process go in. Also the processes are generous, so when a process goes 
in, it checks if there is another process that want to go in. Moreover, the process will not wait an 
infinite time to enter the critical section, because the process that now in critical section makes it's 
logic while the other process makes a busy wait on the while loop, and in the moment that the process 
in critical section call leaveCriticalSection function, the waiting process immediately will enter the 
critical section, because one of the while condition (interested[otherProcess]) will become false, end 
the waiting process will enter the critical section.This time won't be infinite, and will not cause 
starvation of the waiting in the while loop process, because there is an assumption that the process 
that in the critical section will make it's instructions in final time (and not infinite).
